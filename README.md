Scala-ONTAPI
==============================

ONTAPI is NetApp API to connect to ONTAP-based storage. Also known as ZAPI, it is a complete set of API calls to probe and manipulate the storage.

This project is to make ONTAPI elements first-class citizens. To build objects around connection element, create storage objects (volumes, network interfaces, namespace, etc.) and populate them based on responses from the storage.

The project is based on TypeSafe Activator activator-akka-scala-seed template. while it was used mostly as a startig point and most code from the template should be cleaned, you might find residues still :)
